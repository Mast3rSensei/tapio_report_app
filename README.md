1. Start from HTML/Jinja. Define how the report will be showed (fields and stuff): looking at the HTML is much easier to then define the backend behind it (what should happen when I press this button?)
3. Then let's go with the views: let's define what should happen when we open the first page, and what should happen with some type of actions;
4. Last but not least, the models. Now that we have a better idea of what are the functions involved, models should be easy to define at this point.
